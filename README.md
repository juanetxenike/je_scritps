# je_scritps

Bash script that creates an vhost apache configuration file for localhost hosting given a hosting name.

## IMPORTANT
This file is only to be used in a protected environment not in production

## TODOS

- Pass path variables to an .env file
- Create the folder with that name
- Allow to also create a database for the default user
- Add a line to /etc/hosts
- Allow for cases and thus install different software on the site folder (moodle, wordpress, drupal, wordpress, laravel, ...)
